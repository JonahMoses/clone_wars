                <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
                <p>Since 1981 Le Central has been serving the "taste of Provence" on the Southeast corner of 8<sup>th</sup> & Lincoln in Denver. </p>
                <p>Conceived with the notion that French food doesn't have to be stuffy, snoody, heavy, or expensive - Le Central offers a plateful at a reasonable price.<br />
                Reason alone to visit Le Central is the Moules et Frites. Everyday at lunch and dinner we offer a menu of several steamed preparations of sweet black mussels sided by a plateful of French Fries
                <ul class="list colortext">
                  <li>$11.95 for lunch, brunch, or dinner</li>
                  <li>Every Monday and Tuesday in October enjoy a  hard shelled Maine lobster grilled, steamed, broiled, or simply poached showcased in a 3 coarse meal
                  <ul class="list colortext">
                    <li>$29.95 half lobster</li>
                    <li>$34.95 whole lobster</li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>

                <p>Every month we offer a weekly prefixe chef menu. In October and continuing into November Le Central follows and completes the sensorial Denver Art Museum Passport to Paris exhibitions by featuring a weekly prix fixe, pairing food and painters. Diners will get an experience as authentic as possible, as most of the painters were passionate about food and left detailed recipes and menus.</p>
                <blockquote>On Friday evening our party of five enjoyed another delicious and relaxing meal at Le Central, my Denver favorite for decades! We enjoyed charcuterie, mussels et frites, beaujolis and flan. Magnifique!</blockquote>
                <blockquote>We chose Le Central while in Denver because my boyfriend LOVES authentic French onion soup and what a great decision that proved to be!  The ambience was lovely.....not pretentious but still classy.  I have never been to France but I would have to think this is as close to a French bistro as you can find in the U.S.  Our waiter was unbelievable!!!  He recommended wine for both of us and they were both delicious!  We started with escargot and mussels, which are my favorite.  I have NEVER had mussels so delicious (and plentiful)!  My bf does not care for mussels but even he enjoyed a few.  I had the duck breast for dinner which was easily the best duck either of us had ever eaten!  The French onion soup was very good, although I only had a few bites as I had plenty of food for myself to enjoy!<br /><br />
                If you are looking for a wonderful meal and environment, make sure to stop in Le Central!!!</blockquote>

                <p>Desserts are prepared in house by Le Central's own pastry chefs. Le Central also offers authentically French delights such as macarons - various flavored ganache nested between to thin flavored cookies. This gluten free treat is exceptional.</p>
